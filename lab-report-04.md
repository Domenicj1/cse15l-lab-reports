# Lab Report 4: VIM (week 8)
---
## Practicing Vim expertise:
1. Step 4 - Log into ieng6
   - Result of ```ssh djernigan@ieng6.ucsd.edu```: ![Image](https://github.com/Domenicj1/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/146692334/0142e3a4-017c-4855-bd8c-ebba952bcd13)
   - Keystroke sequence: ```ssh<space>djernigan@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>```
   - Summary: I ran the `ssh` command with my ieng6 credentials which is the Secure Shell program that creates a "tunnnel" from my personal machine to the remote ieng6 server.
2. Step 5 - Cloning my fork of the lab7 repository (using the SSH URL)
   - Result of ```git clone git@github.com:Domenicj1/lab7.git```: ![Image](https://github.com/Domenicj1/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/146692334/82d7fcac-a660-4332-9e7f-acc631c937d9)
   - Keystroke sequence: ```git<space>clone<space>git@github.com:Domenicj1/lab7.git```
   - Summary: I ran the ```git clone``` command with the SSH URL to my forked repository, essentially downloading the repository to the machine via termial as if directly from the ieng6 terminal.
